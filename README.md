Implementation of the Dijkstra Algorithm for a Point Robot

# How to Run
Run the program by double clicking it or by opening it in an IDE.
Enter the start and goal coordinates as prompted.
The code will check that the provided coordinates are within the workspace and not inside any obstacles.

This is an example of how the input would look like:
> Enter x coordinate value for start coordinate: 6
> 
> Enter y coordinate value for start coordinate: 6
> 
> Enter x coordinate value for goal coordinate: 1175
> 
> Enter y coordinate value for goal coordinate: 130
>
> Exploring nodes...

This is an example of an invalid input:

> Enter x coordinate value for goal coordinate: 650
> 
> Enter y coordinate value for goal coordinate: 250
> 
> Node outside workspace or in obstacle. Choose new goal location
> 
> Enter x coordinate value for goal location:

# Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used:

opencv-python: For visualizing the workspace and creating a video.

numpy: For resizing the arrays used to draw the obstacles with opencv.

# Output
A video file called dijkstra_output.mp4 will be generated in the same directory were the code is ran from after it is done running.
